# Piri Documentation

Welcome to the Piri documentation!
Piri is the software run by all storage providers on the Storacha network. 
Piri can run entirely on its own with no software other than Filecoin Lotus, or it can integrate into Filecoin storage provider operation running Curio.

### "I already run Curio and want to add Storacha support"
→ Follow the **[Piri with Curio](./integrations/piri-with-curio.md)** guide

### "I just want to understand the architecture"
→ Read the **[Architecture Overview](./architecture.md)**

### "I need to run only a PDP server"
→ Follow the **[PDP Server Setup](./guides/pdp-server-piri.md)** guide

### "I need to run only a UCAN server"

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Generate a PEM File
```bash
piri id gen -t=pem
```
See the [PEM File Generation](./common/pem-file-generation.md) guide for details.

### Check Server Health
```bash
# UCAN server
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# PDP server
curl https://pdp.your-domain.com/health
```

### Create a Proof Set
```bash
piri proofset create --key-file=service.pem --pdp-server-url=https://pdp-domain.com
```
