  <h1>Storage Node</h1>
  <p>A piri node that runs on the Storacha network.</p>
</div>

## Usage

### Getting Started

Install [Go](https://go.dev) v1.23.3 or higher.

Next, generate a private key for your piri node. This can be done on any computer, not necessarily the deployment target.

Clone the repo and `cd` into the repo directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storacha/piri.git
cd piri
```

Build and install the CLI tool:

```sh
make install
```

Generate a new identity:

```sh
piri identity gen
```

Make a note of your node identity. The string beginning `Mg` is your private key. Do not share this with anyone!

Next, obtain a delegation allowing your node to publish claims to the Storacha Indexer node(s). Contact the engineers in `#node-providers` on the Storacha Discord - give them your _public_ key (the string beginning with `did:key:`).

### System Requriements

TODO

### Deployment

#### Environment Variables

The environment variables required to start a node are:

```sh
PIRI_PRIVATE_KEY=                # string beginning Mg...
PIRI_PUBLIC_URL=                 # URL the node will be publically accessible at
PIRI_PORT=                       # local port to bind the server to
PIRI_INDEXING_SERVICE_PROOF=     # delegation(s) from the Storacha Indexing node(s)
```

#### Deployment to a VM/Bare Metal

Clone the repo and build the binary as per the [getting started](#getting-started) section. Set environment variables as above. The following command will start the Storage Node daemon:

```sh
piri start
```

#### Deployment to DigitalOcean

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) allows a Storage Node to be deployed to DigitalOcean Apps platform. You'll need to setup a "Spaces Object Storage" bucket to persist data. You must configure the following additional environment variables:

```sh
PIRI_S3_ENDPOINT=
PIRI_S3_REGION=
PIRI_S3_BUCKET=
PIRI_S3_ACCESS_KEY=
PIRI_S3_SECRET_KEY=
```

#### Deployment to AWS

The Terraform scripts in `/deploy` allow a Storage Node to be deployed to AWS. See [deploy/README.md](./deploy/README.md) for instructions.
